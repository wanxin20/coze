/**
 * Iterate several iterables in lockstep.
 *
 * @param objects - The iterable objects of interest.
 *
 * @returns An iterator which yields successive tuples of values where
 *   each value is taken in turn from the provided iterables. It will
 *   be as long as the shortest provided iterable.
 *
 * #### Example
 * ```typescript
 * import { zip } from '../algorithm';
 *
 * let data1 = [1, 2, 3];
 * let data2 = [4, 5, 6];
 *
 * let stream = zip(data1, data2);
 *
 * Array.from(stream);  // [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
 * ```
