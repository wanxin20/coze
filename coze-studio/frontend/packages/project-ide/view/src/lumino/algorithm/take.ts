/**
 * Take a fixed number of items from an iterable.
 *
 * @param object - The iterable object of interest.
 *
 * @param count - The number of items to take from the iterable.
 *
 * @returns An iterator which yields the specified number of items
 *   from the source iterable.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * The returned iterator will exhaust early if the source iterable
 * contains an insufficient number of items.
 *
 * #### Example
 * ```typescript
 * import { take } from '../algorithm';
 *
 * let stream = take([5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1], 3);
 *
 * Array.from(stream);  // [5, 4, 3]
 * ```
