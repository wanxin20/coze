 * Chain together several iterables.

 * @deprecated

 * @param objects - The iterable objects of interest.

 *
 * #### Example
 * ```typescript
 * import { chain } from '../algorithm';
 *
 * let data1 = [1, 2, 3];
 * let data2 = [4, 5, 6];
 *
 * let stream = chain(data1, data2);
 *
 * Array.from(stream);  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * ```
