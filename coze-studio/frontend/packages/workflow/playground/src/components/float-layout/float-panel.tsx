       * - Closing SideSheet directly will cause the Blur event of the form in the drawer to not be triggered, and the UI will be destroyed first
       *
       * Solution ideas:
       * - UI updates need to be prioritized lower than form blur related data updates in the drawer
       *
       * Specific plan:
       * - Use start Transition to lower the priority of UI destruction this time, so that Blur-related data updates can be executed before the UI destruction of the drawer
