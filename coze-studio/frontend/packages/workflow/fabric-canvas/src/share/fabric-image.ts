   * Why + 1?
   * After calculation, the number of storage bits is limited, whether it is scaleX/Y width/height top/left, a little precision will be lost
   * This accuracy is fed back to the picture, that is, there is a little gap between the picture and the border.
   * Here + 1 makes the image appear slightly larger to make up for the gap in accuracy.
   * Disadvantages: The border will cover a little bit of the picture (how much to cover depends on the zoom ratio), and the user basically has no feeling
