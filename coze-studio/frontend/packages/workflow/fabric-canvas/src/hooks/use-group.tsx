/**
 * This is a work in progress, I won't do it for the time being, I'll think about it later.
 * 1. After forming a group, support drilling down and continue to select.
 *  Realization idea:
 *    A. Double-click to ungroup and record the group relationship;
 *    B. Drill down to select subgroups, continue to ungroup, and record group relationships;
 *    Click on the canvas (when no elements are selected) and restore the group (note the z-index).
 *
 * 2. When copying and pasting groups, you need to exclude reference elements
 * 3. Delete group Yes, also need to exclude reference elements
 * 4. Due to the introduction of the group, the principle that all elements are flattened is broken. Be aware of the destructive nature of this change.
 *  egï¼š
 *    A. Get all elements
 *    B. The position calculation of the element is superimposed by each layer of parent elements
 *    C.server-side rendering: Iterate to find all image elements. Restore group after finishing image download
