// Inspire by https://github.com/jantimon/remote-web-worker

// It's a workaround for the fact that the Worker constructor
// accepts only local URLs, not remote URLs:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker
//
// As a workaround this patched Worker constructor will
// use `importScripts` to load the remote script.
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts
//
// Compatibility: Chrome 4+, Firefox 4+, Safari 4+

// TODO: This implementation is very dirty, and it is easy to cause accidents by tampering with the global instance, but for backward compatibility in the short term, it is temporarily reserved. Later needs:
// 1. Switch worker calls in business code to RemoteWebWorker calls
// 2. The package itself needs to add ut.
// 3. Add the lint rule, do not allow direct calls to the Worker, and use the RemoteWebWorker version uniformly
